            *The* :em-strong:`fastest possible` *math rendering for the modern web.*

            With latest advancements in web tech, the browser should no longer
            *struggle* to render math. Yet it still does. Why *jump around*
            several times until the math settles down? Why *stutter* for
            *seconds* in a heavy JavaScript renderer from a third-party CDN
            that gets shut down every once a while? Why *saturate* the network
            with extra requests for every small snippet? You don't need
            *any of that*.

            Embed math directly in HTML5 markup as pure paths, cutting away all
            external dependencies or extra fonts. And having the SVG inline
            means you can make use of all the CSS goodies on it.

            As you unleash the full power of a static site generator to convert
            LaTeX formulas to vector graphics locally, your viewers are saved
            from needless HTTP requests and heavy JavaScript processing.

                Start using Pelican

    .. container:: m-col-m-4

        .. block-info:: You are *completely* in charge

            Since the math is rendered by your local TeX installation, you have
            the full control over its appearance and you can be sure that it
            will also render the same on all browsers. Now or two years later.

==========

Be sure to refresh your browser a couple of times to see how the rendering
performs and that there is no blank space or jumping until the math appears.
View the page source to verify that there is nothing extra being loaded to make
this happen.

    .. math::

        \pi = \cfrac{4} {1+\cfrac{1^2} {2+\cfrac{3^2} {2+\cfrac{5^2} {2+\ddots}}}}
            = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4(-1)^n}{2n+1}
            = \frac{4}{1} - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{4}{5} - \frac{4}{7} +- \cdots

Matrices render pretty well also:

    .. math::

        R = \begin{pmatrix}
        \langle\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{a}_1\rangle & \langle\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{a}_2\rangle &  \langle\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{a}_3\rangle  & \ldots \\
        0                & \langle\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{a}_2\rangle                        &  \langle\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{a}_3\rangle  & \ldots \\
        0                & 0                                       & \langle\mathbf{e}_3,\mathbf{a}_3\rangle                          & \ldots \\
        \vdots           & \vdots                                  & \vdots                                    & \ddots \end{pmatrix}.

And :text-primary:`everything can be colored` just by putting CSS classes
around:

    .. math::
        :class: m-primary

        X_{k+N} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} (k+N) n} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} k n}  \underbrace{e^{-2 \pi i n}}_{1} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} k n} = X_k.

And now, finally, some inline math. Note the vertical alignment, consistent
line spacing and that nothing gets relayouted during page load:

    Multiplying :math:`x_n` by a *linear phase* :math:`e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}n m}`
    for some integer :math:`m` corresponds to a *circular shift* of the output
    :math:`X_k`: :math:`X_k` is replaced by :math:`X_{k-m}`, where the
    subscript is interpreted `modulo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic>`_
    :math:`N` (i.e., periodically).  Similarly, a circular shift of the input
    :math:`x_n` corresponds to multiplying the output :math:`X_k` by a linear
    phase. Mathematically, if :math:`\{x_n\}` represents the vector
    :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` then

    if :math:`\mathcal{F}(\{x_n\})_k=X_k`

    then :math:`\mathcal{F}(\{ x_n\cdot e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}n m} \})_k=X_{k-m}`

    and :math:`\mathcal{F}(\{x_{n-m}\})_k=X_k\cdot e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N}k m}`
