Gives sane defaults to images and figures and provides a way to present
beautiful image galleries.

`How to use`_
=============

Download the `m/images.py <{filename}/plugins.rst>`_ file, put it including the
``m/`` directory into one of your :py:`PLUGIN_PATHS` and add ``m.images``
package to your :py:`PLUGINS` in ``pelicanconf.py``. This plugin assumes
presence of `m.htmlsanity <{filename}/plugins/htmlsanity.rst>`_.

.. code:: python

    PLUGINS += ['m.htmlsanity', 'm.images']
    M_IMAGES_REQUIRE_ALT_TEXT = False

To use the image grid feature (see below), in addition you need the
`Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_ library installed. Get it via
``pip`` or your distribution package manager:

.. code:: sh

    pip3 install Pillow

`Images, figures`_
==================

The plugin overrides the builtin
`image <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#image>`__
and `figure <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure>`__
directives and:

-   Adds :css:`.m-image` / :css:`.m-figure` CSS classes to them so they have
    the expected m.css `image <{filename}/css/components.rst#images>`_ and
    `figure <{filename}/css/components.rst#figures>`_ styling.
-   Removes the :rst:`:align:`, :rst:`:figwidth:` and :rst:`:scale:` options,
    as this is better handled by m.css features.
-   To maintain accessibility easier, makes it possible to enforce :rst:`:alt:`
    text for every image and figure by setting :py:`M_IMAGES_REQUIRE_ALT_TEXT`
    to :py:`True`.

You can add `additional CSS classes <{filename}/css/components.rst#images>`_ to
images or figures via the :rst:`:class:` or :rst:`:figclass:` options,
respectively. If you want the image or figure to be clickable, use the
:rst:`:target:` option. The alt text can be specified using the :rst:`:alt:`
option for both images and figures.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: rst

        .. image:: flowers.jpg
            :target: flowers.jpg
            :alt: Flowers

        .. figure:: ship.jpg
            :alt: Ship

`Image grid`_
=============

Use the :rst:`.. image-grid::` directive for creating
`image grid <{filename}/css/components.rst#image-grid>`_. Directive contents
are a list of image URLs, blank lines separate grid rows. The plugin
automatically extracts size information and scales the images accordingly. If
the image has EXIF information, properties such as aperture, shutter speed and
ISO are extracted and displayed in the caption on hover. The images are also
made clickable, the target is the image file itself.

Example of a two-row image grid is below. Sorry for reusing the same two images
all over (I'm making it easier for myself); if you want to see a live example
with non-repeating images, head over to `my blog <http://blog.mosra.cz/cesty/mainau/>`_.

.. code:: rst

    .. image-grid::

        {filename}/ship.jpg
        {filename}/flowers.jpg

        {filename}/flowers.jpg
        {filename}/ship.jpg

.. image-grid::

    {filename}/static/ship.jpg
    {filename}/static/flowers.jpg

    {filename}/static/flowers.jpg
    {filename}/static/ship.jpg

.. note-warning::

    Unlike with the image and figure directives above, Pelican *needs* to have
    the images present on a filesystem to extract size information. It's
    advised to use the builtin *absolute* ``{filename}`` or ``{attach}`` syntax
    for `linking to internal content <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html#linking-to-internal-content>`_.
