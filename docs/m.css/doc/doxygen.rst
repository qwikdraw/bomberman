A modern, mobile-friendly drop-in replacement for the stock
`Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org>`_ HTML output, generated from
Doxygen-produced XML files. Generated filenames and URLs are fully compatible
with the stock output to avoid broken links once you switch.

.. note-success::

    Because a live example says more than a thousand words, go check out
    http://doc.magnum.graphics first --- it contains docs for the
    `Magnum graphics engine <http://magnum.graphics>`_ generated with the
    latest ever-improving version of this theme.

`Basic usage`_
==============

.. note-warning::

    The script depends on features released in Doxygen 1.8.14 (December 2017).
    It may work reasonably well with older versions, but I can't guarantee
    that. Upgrade to the latest version to have the best experience.

    Some features depend on patches that are not yet integrated in Doxygen, in
    that case the documentation mentions which revision to use or which patch
    you need to apply.

Everything you need apart from Doxygen itself is a Python script and a bunch of
template files. You can get that by cloning :gh:`the m.css GitHub repository <mosra/m.css$master/doxygen>`
and looking into the ``doxygen/`` directory:

.. code:: sh

    git clone git://github.com/mosra/m.css
    cd m.css/doxygen

The script requires Python 3.6, depends on `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_
for templating and `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ for code block
highlighting. You can install the dependencies via ``pip`` or your distribution
package manager:

.. code:: sh

    pip install jinja2 Pygments

If your documentation includes math formulas, in addition you need some LaTeX
distribution installed. Use your distribution package manager, for example on
Ubuntu:

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra

.. note-success::

    This tool makes use of the ``latex2svg.py`` utility from :gh:`tuxu/latex2svg`,
    © 2017 `Tino Wagner <http://www.tinowagner.com/>`_, licensed under
    :gh:`MIT <tuxu/latex2svg$master/LICENSE.md>`.

Now, in order to preserve your original Doxygen configuration, create a new
``Doxyfile-mcss`` file next to your original ``Doxyfile`` and put the following
inside:

.. code:: ini

    @INCLUDE                = Doxyfile
    GENERATE_HTML           = NO
    GENERATE_XML            = YES
    XML_PROGRAMLISTING      = NO

This will derive the configuration from the original ``Doxyfile``, disables
builtin Doxygen HTML output and enables XML output instead, with some unneeded
features disabled for faster processing. Now run ``dox2html5.py`` and point it
to your ``Doxyfile-mcss``:

.. code:: sh

    ./dox2html5.py path/to/your/Doxyfile-mcss

It will run ``doxygen`` to generate the XML output, processes it and generates
the HTML output in the configured output directory. After the script is done,
just open generated ``index.html`` to see the result.

`Features`_
===========

-   Modern, valid, mobile-friendly HTML5 markup without table layouts
-   Minimalistic design without unnecessary chrome and UI elements
-   URLs fully compatible with stock Doxygen HTML output to preserve existing
    links
-   Focused on presenting the actual written documentation while reducing
    questionable auto-generated content
-   Math rendered as `embedded SVG <{filename}/css/components.rst#math>`_
    instead of raster images / MathJax
-   Uses Pygments for better code highlighting

`Important differences to stock HTML output`_
---------------------------------------------

-   Vastly improved search capabilities with immediate feedback
-   Detailed description is put first and foremost on a page, *before* the
    member listing
-   Files, directories and symbols that don't have any documentation are not
    present in the output at all. This is done in order to encourage good
    documentation practices.
-   Table of contents is generated for compound references as well, containing
    all sections of detailed description together with anchors to member
    listings
-   Private members and anonymous namespaces are always ignored, however
    private virtual functions are listed in case they are documented
    (`why? <http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm>`_)
-   Inner classes are listed in the public/protected type sections instead of
    being listed in a separate section ignoring their public/private status
-   Class references contain also their template specification on the linked
    page
-   Function signatures don't contain :cpp:`constexpr` and :cpp:`noexcept`
    anymore. These keywords are instead added as flags to the function
    description together with :cpp:`virtual`\ ness and :cpp:`explicit`\ ity. On
    the other hand, important properties like :cpp:`static`, :cpp:`const` and
    r-value overloads *are* part of function signature.
-   For better visual alignment, function listing is done using the C++11
    trailing return type (:cpp:`auto` in front) and typedef listing is done
    with :cpp:`using`). However, the detailed documentation is kept in the
    original form.
-   Function and macro parameters and enum values are vertically aligned in
    the member listing for better readability
-   Default class template parameters are not needlessly repeated in each
    member detailed docs
-   Deprecation markers are propagated to member and compound listing pages and
    search results; :cpp:`delete`\ d functions are marked in search as well

`Intentionally unsupported features`_
-------------------------------------

.. note-danger:: Warning: opinions

    This list presents my opinions. Not everybody likes my opinions.

Features that I don't see a point in because they just artifically inflate the
amount of generated content for no added value.

-   Class hierarchy graphs are ignored (it only inflates the documentation with
    little added value)
-   Alphabetical list of symbols and alphabetical list of all members of a
    class is not created (the API *should be* organized in a way that makes
    this unnecessary, there's also search for this)
-   Verbatim listing of parsed headers, "Includes" and "Included By" lists are
    not present (use your IDE or GitHub instead)
-   Brief description for enum values is ignored (only the detailed description
    is used, as the brief description was never used anywhere else than next to
    the detailed description)
-   Initializers of defines and variables are unconditionally ignored (one can
    always look in the sources, if really needed)
-   No section with list of examples or linking from function/class
    documentation to related example code (he example code should be
    accompanied with corresponding tutorial page instead)
-   :cpp:`inline` functions are not marked as such (I see it as an unimportant
    implementation detail)
-   ``@section``, ``@subsection`` etc. commands inside anything else than
    top-level documentation of a class, namespace, file, directory, page or
    module are not supported as the visual layout is not expecting such things

`Not yet implemented features`_
-------------------------------

-   Clickable symbols in code snippets. Doxygen has quite a lot of false
    positives while a lot of symbols stay unmatched. I need to find a way
    around that.

`Configuration`_
================

The script takes most of the configuration from the ``Doxyfile`` itself,
(ab)using the following builtin options:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=============================== ===============================================
Variable                        Description
=============================== ===============================================
:ini:`@INCLUDE`                 Includes in ``Doxyfile``\ s are supported
:ini:`PROJECT_NAME`             Rendered in top navbar, footer fine print and
                                page title
:ini:`PROJECT_BRIEF`            If set, appended in a thinner font to
                                :ini:`PROJECT_NAME`
:ini:`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`         Used to discover where Doxygen generates the
                                files
:ini:`XML_OUTPUT`               Used to discover where Doxygen puts the
                                generated XML
:ini:`HTML_OUTPUT`              The output will be written here
:ini:`TAGFILES`                 Used to discover what base URL to prepend to
                                external references
:ini:`HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET`    List of CSS files to include. Relative paths
                                are also searched relative to the
                                ``dox2html5.py`` script. See below for more
                                information.
:ini:`HTML_EXTRA_FILES`         List of extra files to copy (for example
                                additional CSS files that are :css:`@import`\ ed
                                from the primary one). Relative paths are also
                                searched relative to the ``dox2html5.py``
                                script.
=============================== ===============================================

In addition, the m.css Doxygen theme recognizes the following extra options:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=================================== =======================================
Variable                            Description
=================================== =======================================
:ini:`M_THEME_COLOR`                Color for :html:`<meta name="theme-color" />`,
                                    corresponding to the CSS style. If empty,
                                    no :html:`<meta>` tag is rendered. See
                                    `Theme selection`_ for more information.
:ini:`M_FAVICON`                    Favicon URL, used to populate
                                    :html:`<link rel="icon" />`. If empty, no
                                    :html:`<link>` tag is rendered.
:ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR1`              Left navbar column links. See
                                    `Navbar links`_ for more information.
:ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR2`              Right navbar column links. See
                                    `Navbar links`_ for more information.
:ini:`M_PAGE_HEADER`                HTML code to put at the top of every page.
                                    Useful for example to link to different
                                    versions of the same documentation. The
                                    ``{filename}`` placeholder is replaced with
                                    current file name.
:ini:`M_PAGE_FINE_PRINT`            HTML code to put into the footer. If not
                                    set, a default generic text is used. If
                                    empty, no footer is rendered at all. The
                                    ``{doxygen_version}`` placeholder is
                                    replaced with Doxygen version that
                                    generated the input XML files.
:ini:`M_CLASS_TREE_EXPAND_LEVELS`   How many levels of the class tree to
                                    expand. ``0`` means only the top-level
                                    symbols are shown. If not set, ``1`` is
                                    used.
:ini:`M_FILE_TREE_EXPAND_LEVELS`    How many levels of the file tree to expand.
                                    ``0`` means only the top-level dirs/files
                                    are shown. If not set, ``1`` is used.
:ini:`M_EXPAND_INNER_TYPES`         Whether to expand inner types (e.g. a class
                                    inside a class) in the symbol tree. If not
                                    set, ``NO`` is used.
:ini:`M_SEARCH_DISABLED`            Disable search functionality. If this
                                    option is set, no search data is compiled
                                    and the rendered HTML does not contain any
                                    search-related UI or support. If not set,
                                    ``NO`` is used.
:ini:`M_SEARCH_DOWNLOAD_BINARY`     Download search data as a binary to save
                                    bandwidth and initial processing time. If
                                    not set, ``NO`` is used. See `Search`_ for
                                    more information.
:ini:`M_SEARCH_HELP`                HTML code to display as help text on empty
                                    search popup. If not set, a default message
                                    is used. Has effect only if
                                    :ini:`M_SEARCH_DISABLED` is not ``YES``.
:ini:`M_SEARCH_EXTERNAL_URL`        URL for external search. The ``{query}``
                                    placeholder is replaced with urlencoded
                                    search string. If not set, no external
                                    search is offered. See `Search`_ for more
                                    information. Has effect only if
                                    :ini:`M_SEARCH_DISABLED` is not ``YES``.
=================================== =======================================

Note that namespace, directory and page lists are always fully expanded as
these are not expected to be excessively large.

`Theme selection`_
------------------

By default, the `dark m.css theme <{filename}/css/themes.rst#dark>`_ together
with Doxygen-theme-specific additions is used, which corresponds to the
following configuration:

.. code:: ini

    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET = \
        https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,400i,600,600i%7CSource+Code+Pro:400,400i,600 \
        ../css/m-dark+doxygen.compiled.css
    M_THEME_COLOR = #22272e

If you have a site already using the ``m-dark.compiled.css`` file, there's
another file called ``m-dark.doxygen.compiled.css``, which contains just the
Doxygen-theme-specific additions so you can reuse the already cached
``m-dark.compiled.css`` file from your main site:

.. code:: ini

    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET = \
        https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,400i,600,600i%7CSource+Code+Pro:400,400i,600 \
        ../css/m-dark.compiled.css \
        ../css/m-dark.doxygen.compiled.css
    M_THEME_COLOR = #22272e

If you prefer the `light m.css theme <{filename}/css/themes.rst#light>`_
instead, use the following configuration (and, similarly, you can use
``m-light.compiled.css`` together with ``m-light.doxygen.compiled-css`` in
place of ``m-light+doxygen.compiled.css``:

.. code:: ini

    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET = \
        https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Libre+Baskerville:400,400i,700,700i%7CSource+Code+Pro:400,400i,600 \
        ../css/m-light+doxygen.compiled.css
    M_THEME_COLOR = #cb4b16

See the `CSS files`_ section below for more information about customizing the
CSS files.

`Navbar links`_
---------------

The :ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR1` and :ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR2` options define which
links are shown on the top navbar, split into left and right column on small
screen sizes. These options take a whitespace-separated list of compound IDs
and additionally the special ``pages``, ``modules``, ``namespaces``,
``annotated``, ``files`` IDs. By default the variables are defined like
following:

.. code:: ini

    M_LINKS_NAVBAR1 = pages namespaces
    M_LINKS_NAVBAR2 = annotated files

.. note-info::

    The theme by default assumes that the project is grouping symbols in
    namespaces. If you use modules (``@addtogroup`` and related commands) and
    you want to show their index in the navbar, add ``modules`` to one of
    the :ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR*` options, for example:

    .. code:: ini

        M_LINKS_NAVBAR1 = pages modules
        M_LINKS_NAVBAR2 = annotated files

Titles for the links are taken implicitly. Empty :ini:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR2` will
cause the navigation appear in a single column, setting both empty will cause
the navbar links to not be rendered at all.

A menu item is higlighted if a compound with the same ID is the current page
(and similarly for the special ``pages``, ... IDs).

It's possible to specify sub-menu items by enclosing more than one ID in
quotes. The top-level items then have to be specified each on a single line.
Example (note the mangled names, corresponding to filenames of given compounds
generated by Doxygen):

.. code:: ini

    M_LINKS_NAVBAR1 = \
        "namespaces namespaceFoo namespaceBar namespaceUtils" \
        "files dir_d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00 dir_cbd8f7984c654c25512e3d9241ae569f"

This will put links to namespaces Foo, Bar and Utils as a sub-items of a
top-level *Namespaces* item and links to two subdirectories as sub-items of the
*Files* item.

`Search`_
---------

Symbol search is implemented using JavaScript Typed Arrays and does not need
any server-side functionality to perform well --- the client automatically
downloads a tightly packed binary containing search data and performs search
directly on it.

However, due to `restrictions of Chromium-based browsers <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40787&q=ajax%20local&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS>`_,
it's not possible to download data using :js:`XMLHttpRequest` when served from
a local file-system. Because of that, the search defaults to producing a
Base85-encoded representation of the search binary and loading that
asynchronously as a plain JavaScript file. This results in the search data
being 25% larger, but since this is for serving from a local filesystem, it's
not considered a problem. If your docs are accessed through a server (or you
don't need Chrome support), enable the :ini:`M_SEARCH_DOWNLOAD_BINARY` option.

If :ini:`M_SEARCH_EXTERNAL_URL` is specified, full-text search using an
external search engine is offered if nothing is found for given string or if
the user has JavaScript disabled. It's recommended to restrict the search to
a particular domain or add additional keywords to the search query to filter
out irrelevant results. Example, using Google search engine and restricting
the search to a subdomain:

.. code:: ini

    M_SEARCH_EXTERNAL_URL = "https://google.com/search?q=site:doc.magnum.graphics+{query}"

`Content`_
==========

Brief and detailed description is parsed as-is with the following
modifications:

-   Function parameter documentation, return value documentation and template
    parameter documentation is extracted out of the text flow to allow for more
    flexible styling, it's also reordered to match parameter order and warnings
    are emitted if there are mismatches.
-   To make text content wrap better on narrow screens, :html:`<wbr/>` tags are
    added after ``::`` and ``_`` in long symbols in link titles and after ``/``
    in URLs.

Single-paragraph list items, function parameter description, table cell content
and return value documentation is stripped from the enclosing :html:`<p>` tag
to make the output more compact. If multiple paragraphs are present, nothing is
stripped. In case of lists, they are then rendered in an inflated form.
However, in order to achieve even spacing also with single-paragraph items,
it's needed use some explicit markup. Adding :html:`<p></p>` to a
single-paragraph item will make sure the enclosing :html:`<p>` is not stripped.

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: c++

        /**
        -   A list

            of multiple

            paragraphs.

        -   Another item

            <p></p>

            -   A sub list

                Another paragraph
        */

    .. raw:: html

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A list</p>
            <p>of multiple</p>
            <p>paragraphs.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Another item</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A sub list</p>
                <p>Another paragraph</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

`Images and figures`_
---------------------

To match the stock HTML output, images that are marked with ``html`` target are
used. If image name is present, the image is rendered as a figure with caption.

`Pages, sections and table of contents`_
----------------------------------------

Table of contents is unconditionally generated for all compound documentation
pages and includes both ``@section`` blocks in the detailed documentation as
well as the reference sections. If your documentation is using Markdown-style
headers (prefixed with ``##``, for example), the script is not able to generate
TOC entries for these. Upon encountering them, tt will warn and suggest to use
the ``@section`` command instead.

Table of contents for pages is generated only if they specify
``@tableofcontents`` in their documentation block.

`Namespace members in file scope`_
----------------------------------

Doxygen by default doesn't render namespace members for file documentation in
its XML output. To match the behavior of stock HTML output, enable the
:ini:`XML_NAMESPACE_MEMBERS_IN_FILE_SCOPE` option:

.. code:: ini

    # Requires a patch to Doxygen 1.8.14, see below
    XML_NAMESPACE_MEMBERS_IN_FILE_SCOPE = YES

.. note-warning:: Doxygen patches

    In order to use the :ini:`XML_NAMESPACE_MEMBERS_IN_FILE_SCOPE` option, you
    need Doxygen with :gh:`doxygen/doxygen#653` applied.

`Code highlighting`_
--------------------

Every code snippet should be annotated with language-specific extension like in
the example below. If not, the theme will assume C++ and emit a warning on
output. Language of snippets included via ``@include`` and related commands is
autodetected from filename.

.. code:: c++

    /**
    @code{.cpp}
    int main() { }
    @endcode
    */

Besides native Pygments mapping of file extensions to languages, there are the
following special cases:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=================== ===========================================================
Filename suffix     Detected language
=================== ===========================================================
``.h``              C++ (instead of C)
``.h.cmake``        C++ (instead of CMake), as this extension is often used for
                    C++ headers that are preprocessed with CMake
``.glsl``           GLSL. For some reason, stock Pygments detect only
                    ``.vert``, ``.frag`` and ``.geo`` extensions as GLSL.
``.conf``           INI (key-value configuration files)
``.ansi``           `Colored terminal output <{filename}/css/components.rst#colored-terminal-output>`_.
                    Use ``.shell-session`` pseudo-extension for simple
                    uncolored terminal output.
=================== ===========================================================

The theme has experimental support for inline code highlighting. Inline code is
distinguished from code blocks using the following rules:

-   Code that is delimited from surrounding paragraphs with an empty line is
    considered as block.
-   Code that is coming from ``@include``, ``@snippet`` and related commands
    that paste external file content is always considered as block.
-   Code that is coming from ``@code`` and is not alone in a paragraph is
    considered as inline.
-   For compatibility reasons, if code that is detected as inline consists of
    more than one line, it's rendered as code block and a warning is printed to
    output.

Inline highlighted code is written also using the ``@code`` command, but as
writing things like

.. code:: c++

    /** Returns @code{.cpp} Magnum::Vector2 @endcode, which is
        @code{.glsl} vec2 @endcode in GLSL. */

is too verbose, it's advised to configure some aliases in your ``Doxyfile-mcss``.
For example, you can configure an alias for general inline code snippets and
shorter versions for commonly used languages like C++ and CMake.

.. code:: ini

    ALIASES += \
        "cb{1}=@code{\1}" \
        "ce=@endcode" \
        "cpp=@code{.cpp}" \
        "cmake=@code{.cmake}"

With this in place the above could be then written simply as:

.. code:: c++

    /** Returns @cpp Magnum::Vector2 @ce, which is @cb{.glsl} vec2 @ce in GLSL. */

If you need to preserve compatibility with stock Doxygen HTML output (because
it renders all ``@code`` sections as blocks), use the following fallback
aliases in the original ``Doxyfile``:

.. code:: ini

    ALIASES += \
        "cb{1}=<tt>" \
        "ce=</tt>" \
        "cpp=<tt>" \
        "cmake=<tt>"

.. block-warning:: Doxygen limitations

    It's not possible to use inline code highlighting in ``@brief``
    description. Code placed there is moved by Doxygen to the detailed
    description. Similarly, it's not possible to use it in an ``@xrefitem``
    (``@todo``, ``@bug``...) paragraph --- code placed there is moved to a
    paragraph after (but it works as expected for ``@note`` and similar).

    It's not possible to put a ``@code`` block (delimited by blank lines) to a
    Markdown list. A workaround is to use explicit HTML markup instead. See
    `Content`_ for more information about list behavior.

    .. code-figure::

        .. code:: c++

            /**
            <ul>
            <li>
                A paragraph.

                @code{.cpp}
                #include <os>
                @endcode
            </li>
            <li>
                Another paragraph.

                Yet another
            </li>
            </ul>
            */

        .. raw:: html

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A paragraph.</p>
                <pre class="m-code"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;os&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Another paragraph.</p>
                <p>Yet another</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

`Theme-specific commands`_
--------------------------

It's possible to insert custom m.css classes into the Doxygen output. Add the
following to your ``Doxyfile-mcss``:

.. code:: ini

    ALIASES += \
        "m_div{1}=@xmlonly<mcss:div xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:class=\"\1\">@endxmlonly" \
        "m_enddiv=@xmlonly</mcss:div>@endxmlonly" \
        "m_span{1}=@xmlonly<mcss:span xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:class=\"\1\">@endxmlonly" \
        "m_endspan=@xmlonly</mcss:span>@endxmlonly" \
        "m_class{1}=@xmlonly<mcss:class xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:class=\"\1\" />@endxmlonly" \
        "m_footernavigation=@xmlonly<mcss:footernavigation xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" />@endxmlonly" \
        "m_examplenavigation{2}=@xmlonly<mcss:examplenavigation xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:page=\"\1\" mcss:prefix=\"\2\" />@endxmlonly" \
        "m_keywords{1}=@xmlonly<mcss:search xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:keywords=\"\1\" />@endxmlonly" \
        "m_keyword{3}=@xmlonly<mcss:search xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:keyword=\"\1\" mcss:title=\"\2\" mcss:suffix-length=\"\3\" />@endxmlonly" \
        "m_enum_values_as_keywords=@xmlonly<mcss:search xmlns:mcss=\"http://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/\" mcss:enum-values-as-keywords=\"true\" />@endxmlonly"

If you need backwards compatibility with stock Doxygen HTML output, just make
the aliases empty in your original ``Doxyfile``. Note that you can rename the
aliases however you want to fit your naming scheme.

.. code:: ini

    ALIASES += \
        "m_div{1}=" \
        "m_enddiv=" \
        "m_span{1}=" \
        "m_endspan=" \
        "m_class{1}=" \
        "m_footernavigation=" \
        "m_examplenavigation{2}" \
        "m_keywords{1}=" \
        "m_keyword{3}=" \
        "m_enum_values_as_keywords="

With ``@m_div`` and ``@m_span`` it's possible to wrap individual paragraphs or
inline text in :html:`<div>` / :html:`<span>` and add CSS classes to them.
Example usage and corresponding rendered HTML output:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: c++

        /**
        @div{m-note m-dim m-text-center} This paragraph is rendered in a dim
        note, centered. @enddiv

        This text contains a @span{m-text m-success} green @endspan word.
        */

    .. note-dim::
        :class: m-text-center

        This paragraph is rendered in a dim note, centered.

    .. role:: success
        :class: m-text m-success

    This text contains a :success:`green` word.

.. note-warning::

    Note that due to Doxygen XML output limitations it's not possible to wrap
    multiple paragraphs this way, attempt to do that will result in an invalid
    XML file that can't be processed. Similarly, if you forget a closing
    ``@enddiv`` / ``@endspan`` or misplace them, the result will be an invalid
    XML file.

With ``@m_class`` it's possible to add CSS classes to the immediately following
paragraph, image, table, list or math formula block. When used inline, it
affects the immediately following emphasis, strong text, link or inline math
formula. Example usage:

.. code-figure::

    .. code:: c++

        /** See the red @m_class{m-danger} @f$ \Sigma @f$ character. */

    .. role:: math-danger(math)
        :class: m-danger

    See the red :math-danger:`\Sigma` character.

The ``@m_footernavigation`` command is similar to ``@tableofcontents``, but
across pages --- if a page is a subpage of some other page and this command is
present in page detailed description, it will cause the footer of the rendered
page to contain a link to previous, parent and next page according to defined
page order.

The ``@m_examplenavigation`` command is able to put breadcrumb navigation to
parent page(s) of ``@example`` listings in order to make it easier for users to
return back from example source code to a tutorial page, for example. When used
in combination with ``@m_footernavigation``, navigation to parent page and to
prev/next file of the same example is put at the bottom of the page. The
``@m_examplenavigation`` command takes two arguments, first is the parent page
for this example (used to build the breadcrumb and footer navigation), second
is example path prefix (which is then stripped from page title and is also used
to discover which example files belong together). Example usage --- the
``@m_examplenavigation`` and ``@m_footernavigation`` commands are simply
appended the an existing ``@example`` command.

.. code:: c++

    /**
    @example helloworld/CMakeLists.txt @m_examplenavigation{example,helloworld/} @m_footernavigation
    @example helloworld/configure.h.cmake @m_examplenavigation{example,helloworld/} @m_footernavigation
    @example helloworld/main.cpp @m_examplenavigation{example,helloworld/} @m_footernavigation
    */

The purpose of ``@m_keywords``, ``@m_keyword`` and ``@m_enum_values_as_keywords``
command is to add further search keywords to given documented symbols. Use
``@m_keywords`` to enter whitespace-separated list of keywords. Use ``@m_keyword``
if you need to enter a keyword containing spaces, the optional second and third
parameter allow you to specify a different title and suffix length. The
``@m_enum_values_as_keywords`` command will add initializers of given enum
values as keywords for each corresponding value, it's ignored when not used in
enum description block. In the following example, an OpenGL wrapper API adds GL
API names as keywords for easier discoverability, so e.g. the
:cpp:`Texture2D::setStorage()` function is also found when typing
``glTexStorage2D()`` into the search field, or the :cpp:`Renderer::Feature::DepthTest`
enum value is found when entering :cpp:`GL_DEPTH_TEST`:

.. code:: c++

    /**
     * @brief Set texture storage
     *
     * @m_keywords{glTexStorage2D() glTextureStorage2D()}
     */
    Texture2D& Texture2D::setStorage(...);

    /**
     * @brief Renderer feature
     *
     * @m_enum_values_as_keywords
     */
    enum class RendererFeature: GLenum {
        /** Depth test */
        DepthTest = GL_DEPTH_TEST,

        ...
    };

`Command-line options`_
=======================

.. code:: sh

    ./dox2html5.py [-h] [--templates TEMPLATES] [--wildcard WILDCARD]
                   [--index-pages INDEX_PAGES [INDEX_PAGES ...]]
                   [--no-doxygen] [--search-no-subtree-merging]
                   [--search-no-lookahead-barriers]
                   [--search-no-prefix-merging] [--sort-globbed-files]
                   [--debug]
                   doxyfile

Arguments:

-   ``doxyfile`` --- where the Doxyfile is

Options:

-   ``-h``, ``--help`` --- show this help message and exit
-   ``--templates TEMPLATES`` --- template directory. Defaults to the
    ``templates/`` subdirectory if not set.
-   ``--wildcard WILDCARD`` --- only process files matching the wildcard.
    Useful for debugging to speed up / restrict the processing to a subset of
    files. Defaults to ``*.xml`` if not set.
-   ``--index-pages INDEX_PAGES [INDEX_PAGES ...]`` --- index page templates.
    By default, if not set, the index pages are matching stock Doxygen, i.e.
    ``annotated.html``, ``files.html``, ``modules.html``, ``namespaces.html``
    and ``pages.html``.
    See `Navigation page templates`_ section below for more information.
-   ``--no-doxygen`` --- don't run Doxygen before. By default Doxygen is run
    before the script to refresh the generated XML output.
-   ``--search-no-subtree-merging`` --- don't optimize search data size by
    merging subtrees
-   ``--search-no-lookahead-barriers`` --- don't insert search lookahead
    barriers that improve search result relevance
-   ``--search-no-prefix-merging`` --- don't merge search result prefixes
-   ``--sort-globbed-files`` --- sort globbed files for better reproducibility
-   ``--debug`` --- verbose debug output. Useful for debugging.

`Customizing the template`_
===========================

The rest of the documentation explains how to customize the builtin template to
better suit your needs. Each documentation file is generated from one of the
template files that are bundled with the script. However, it's possible to
provide your own Jinja2 template files for customized experience as well as
modify the CSS styling.

`CSS files`_
------------

By default, compiled CSS files are used to reduce amount of HTTP requests and
bandwidth needed for viewing the documentation. However, for easier
customization and debugging it's better to use the unprocessed stylesheets. The
:ini:`HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET` lists all files that go to the :html:`<link rel="stylesheet" />`
in the resulting HTML markup, while :ini:`HTML_EXTRA_FILES` lists the
indirectly referenced files that need to be copied to the output as well. Below
is an example configuration corresponding to the dark theme:

.. code:: ini

    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET = \
        https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,400i,600,600i%7CSource+Code+Pro:400,400i,600 \
        ../css/m-dark.css \
        ../css/m-doxygen.css
    HTML_EXTRA_FILES = \
        ../css/m-grid.css \
        ../css/m-components.css \
        ../css/pygments-dark.css \
        ../css/pygments-console.css
    M_THEME_COLOR = #22272e

After making desired changes to the source files, it's possible to postprocess
them back to the compiled version using the ``postprocess.py`` utility as
explained in the `CSS themes <{filename}/css/themes.rst#make-your-own>`_
documentation. In case of the dark theme, the ``m-dark+doxygen.compiled.css``
and ``m-dark.doxygen.compiled.css`` files are produced like this:

.. code:: sh

    cd css
    ./postprocess.py m-dark.css m-doxygen.css -o m-dark+doxygen.compiled.css
    ./postprocess.py m-dark.css m-doxygen.css --no-import -o m-dark.doxygen.compiled.css

`Compound documentation template`_
----------------------------------

For compound documentation one output HTML file corresponds to one input XML
file and there are some naming conventions imposed by Doxygen.

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

======================= =======================================================
Filename                Use
======================= =======================================================
``class.html``          Class documentation, read from ``class*.xml`` and saved
                        as ``class*.html``
``dir.html``            Directory documentation, read from ``dir_*.xml`` and
                        saved as ``dir_*.html``
``example.html``        Example code listing, read from ``*-example.xml`` and
                        saved as ``*-example.html``
``file.html``           File documentation, read from ``*.xml`` and saved as
                        ``*.html``
``namespace.html``      Namespace documentation, read fron ``namespace*.xml``
                        and saved as ``namespace*.html``
``group.html``          Module documentation, read fron ``group_*.xml``
                        and saved as ``group_*.html``
``page.html``           Page, read from ``*.xml``/``indexpage.xml`` and saved
                        as ``*.html``/``index.html``
``struct.html``         Struct documentation, read from ``struct*.xml`` and
                        saved as ``struct*.html``
``union.html``          Union documentation, read from ``union*.xml`` and saved
                        as ``union*.html``
======================= =======================================================

Each template is passed a subset of the ``Doxyfile`` configuration values from
the `Configuration`_ table. Most values are provided as-is depending on their
type, so either strings, booleans, or lists of strings. The exceptions are:

-   The :py:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR1` and :py:`M_LINKS_NAVBAR2` are processed to tuples
    in a form :py:`(title, url, id, sub)` where :py:`title` is link title,
    :py:`url` is link URL, :py:`id` is compound ID (to use for highlighting
    active menu item) and :py:`sub` is a list optionally containing sub-menu
    items. The sub-menu items are in a similarly formed tuple,
    :py:`(title, url, id)`.
-   The :py:`M_FAVICON` is converted to a tuple of :py:`(url, type)` where
    :py:`url` is the favicon URL and :py:`type` is favicon MIME type to
    populate the ``type`` attribute of :html:`<link rel="favicon" />`.

 and in addition the following variables:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=========================== ===================================================
Variable                    Description
=========================== ===================================================
:py:`FILENAME`              Name of given output file
:py:`DOXYGEN_VERSION`       Version of Doxygen that generated given XML file
=========================== ===================================================

In addition to builtin Jinja2 filters, the ``basename_or_url`` filter returns
either a basename of file path, if the path is relative; or a full URL, if the
argument is an absolute URL. It's useful in cases like this:

.. code:: html+jinja

  {% for css in HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ css|basename_or_url }}" />
  {% endfor %}

The actual page contents are provided in a :py:`compound` object, which has the
following properties. All exposed data are meant to be pasted directly to the
HTML code without any escaping.

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

                        of object described above.
======================= =======================================================

`Navigation page templates`_
----------------------------

By default the theme tries to match the original Doxygen listing pages. These
pages are generated from the ``index.xml`` file and their template name
corresponds to output file name.

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

======================= =======================================================
Filename                Use
======================= =======================================================
``annotated.html``      Class listing
``files.html``          File and directory listing
``modules.html``        Module listing
``namespaces.html``     Namespace listing
``pages.html``          Page listing
======================= =======================================================

By default it's those five pages, but you can configure any other pages via the
``--index-pages`` option as mentioned in the `Command-line options`_ section.

Each template is passed a subset of the ``Doxyfile`` configuration values from
the above table and in addition the :py:`FILENAME` and :py:`DOXYGEN_VERSION`
variables as above. The navigation tree is provided in an :py:`index` object,
which has the following properties:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=========================== ===================================================
Property                    Description
=========================== ===================================================
:py:`index.symbols`         List of all namespaces + classes
:py:`index.files`           List of all dirs + files
:py:`index.pages`           List of all pages
:py:`index.modules`         List of all modules
=========================== ===================================================

The form of each list entry is the same:

.. class:: m-table m-fullwidth

=============================== ===============================================
Property                        Description
=============================== ===============================================
:py:`i.kind`                    Entry kind (one of :py:`'namespace'`,
                                :py:`'group'`, :py:`'class'`, :py:`'struct'`,
                                :py:`'union'`, :py:`'dir'`, :py:`'file'`,
                                :py:`'page'`)
:py:`i.name`                    Name
:py:`i.url`                     URL of the file with detailed documentation
:py:`i.brief`                   Brief documentation
:py:`i.is_deprecated`           Whether the entry is deprecated. [7]_
:py:`i.has_nestable_children`   If the list has nestable children (i.e., dirs
                                or namespaces)
:py:`i.children`                Recursive list of child entries
=============================== ===============================================

Each list is ordered in a way that all namespaces are before all classes and
all directories are before all files.

---------------------------

.. [1] :py:`i.brief` is a single-line paragraph without the enclosing :html:`<p>`
    element, rendered as HTML. Can be empty in case of function overloads.
.. [2] :py:`i.description` is HTML code with the full description, containing
    paragraphs, notes, code blocks, images etc. Can be empty in case just the
    brief description is present.
.. [3] :py:`i.base_url`, joined using ``#`` with :py:`i.id` form a unique URL
    for given symbol. If the :py:`i.base_url` is not the same as
    :py:`compound.url`, it means given symbol is just referenced from given
    compound and its detailed documentation resides elsewhere.
.. [4] :py:`i.name` is just the member name, not qualified. Prepend
    :py:`compound.prefix_wbr` to it to get the fully qualified name.
.. [5] :py:`compound.has_*_details` and :py:`i.has_details` are :py:`True` if
    there is detailed description, function/template/macro parameter
    documentation or enum value listing that makes it worth to render the full
    description block. If :py:`False`, the member should be included only in
    the brief listing on top of the page to avoid unnecessary repetition. If
    :py:`i.base_url` is not the same as :py:`compound.url`, its
    :py:`i.has_details` is always set to :py:`False`.
.. [6] :py:`i.type` and :py:`param.default` is rendered as HTML and usually
    contains links to related documentation
.. [7] :py:`i.is_deprecated` is set to :py:`True` if detailed docs of given
    symbol contain the ``@deprecated`` command and to :py:`False` otherwise
