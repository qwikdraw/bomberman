Pelican plugins
###############

.. role:: py(code)
    :language: py

The `Pelican theme <{filename}/pelican/theme.rst>`_ provided by m.css uses only
a part of the functionality on its own, the rest is exposed by various plugins.

`Usage`_
========

Each plugin is a standalone ``*.py`` file that is meant to be downloaded and
put into a ``m/`` subdirectory into one of your :py:`PLUGIN_PATHS`. Then you
add given :py:`m.something` package to your :py:`PLUGINS` in ``pelicanconf.py``
and restart Pelican. Download the plugins below or
:gh:`grab the whole Git repository <mosra/m.css>`:

-   :gh:`m.htmlsanity <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/htmlsanity.py>`
-   :gh:`m.components <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/components.py>`
-   :gh:`m.images <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/images.py>`
-   :gh:`m.math  <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/math.py>` (needs also :gh:`latex2svg <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/latex2svg.py>`),
    :gh:`m.code <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/code.py>` (needs also :gh:`ansilexer <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/ansilexer.py>`)
-   :gh:`m.gh <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/gh.py>`,
    :gh:`m.dox <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/dox.py>`,
    :gh:`m.gl <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/gl.py>`,
    :gh:`m.abbr <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/abbr.py>`,
    :gh:`m.filesize <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/filesize.py>`
-   :gh:`m.metadata <mosra/m.css$master/pelican-plugins/m/metadata.py>`

Click on the headings below to get to know more. Note that particular plugins
can have additional dependencies besides just Pelican, see documentation of
each of them to see more.

`HTML sanity » <{filename}/plugins/htmlsanity.rst>`_
====================================================

The :py:`m.htmlsanity` plugin is essential for m.css. It makes your markup
valid HTML5, offers a few opt-in typographical improvements and enables you to
make full use of features provided by other plugins.

`Components » <{filename}/plugins/components.rst>`_
===================================================

All `CSS components <{filename}/css/components.rst>`_ are exposed by the
:py:`m.components` plugin, so you can use them via :abbr:`reST <reStructuredText>`
directives without needing to touch HTML and CSS directly.

`Images » <{filename}/plugins/images.rst>`_
===========================================

Image-related CSS components are implemented by the :py:`m.images` plugin,
overriding builtin :abbr:`reST <reStructuredText>` functionality and providing
a convenient automatic way to arrange photos in an image grid.

`Math and code » <{filename}/plugins/math-and-code.rst>`_
=========================================================

The :py:`m.math` and :py:`m.code` plugins use external libraries for math
rendering and syntax highlighting, so they are provided as separate packages
that you can but don't have to use. With these, math and code snippets can be
entered directly in your :abbr:`reST <reStructuredText>` sources.

`Links » <{filename}/plugins/links.rst>`_
=========================================

The :py:`m.gh`, :py:`m.dox`, :py:`m.gl`, :py:`m.abbr` and :py:`m.fiilesize`
plugins make it easy for you to link to GitHub projects, issues or PRs, to
Doxygen documentation and do more useful things.

`Metadata » <{filename}/plugins/metadata.rst>`_
===============================================

With the :py:`m.metadata` plugin it's possible to assign additional description
and images to authors, categories and tags. The information can then appear on
article listing page, as a badge under the article or be added to social meta
tags.
